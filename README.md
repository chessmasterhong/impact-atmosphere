# Impact Day/Night Cycle Plugin

A plugin for the Impact game engine that simulates a day/night system based on
configurable time of day, day of year, and geographical coordinates.


## Features

* Dynamic ambient luminosity
* Variable length of day/night based on geographical coordinates
* Time scale/speed to cycle through day and night quicker or slower


## Basic Usage

## Configuration

## Disclaimer

I would like to emphasize that although this plugin utilizes computations from various creditable sources, its implementation is rather naive and has not been thoroughly tested for accuracy or validity. It's original purpose and intent was to *roughly* simulate a realistic system for a potential game. As a result, I do not encourage using this plugin for sensitive projects or research.
